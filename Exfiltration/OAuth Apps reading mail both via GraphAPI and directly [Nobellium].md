# OAuth Apps reading mail both via GraphAPI and directly [Solorigate]
As described in previous guidance[https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/] the actor may abuse legitimate existing OAuth Applications in the environment. 
However the malicious access pattern may differ from the legitimate one.
The following query returns OAuth Applications that access mail both directly and via Graph, allowing review of whether such dual access methods are expected.

## Query
```
// Look for OAuth Apps reading mail both via GraphAPI, and directly (not via GraphAPI) 
// (one method may be legitimate and one suspect?) 
let appsReadingMailDirectly = CloudAppEvents 
| where Timestamp >= ago(1h) 
| where ActionType == "MailItemsAccessed" 
| where RawEventData has "AppId" 
| extend rawData = parse_json(RawEventData) 
| extend AppId = tostring(parse_json(rawData.AppId)) 
| where AppId != "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000" 
| summarize by AppId 
| project-rename OAuthAppId = AppId; 
let appsReadingMailViaGraphAPI = CloudAppEvents 
| where Timestamp >= ago(1h) 
| where ActionType == "MailItemsAccessed" 
| where RawEventData has "ClientAppId" 
| where RawEventData has "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000" // performance check 
| extend rawData = parse_json(RawEventData) 
| extend AppId = tostring(parse_json(rawData.AppId)) 
| extend OAuthAppId = tostring(parse_json(rawData.ClientAppId)) // extract OAuthAppId 
| where AppId == "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000" 
| summarize by OAuthAppId; 
// Applications reading mail both directly and via GraphAPI  
// (one method may be legitimate and one suspect?) 
appsReadingMailDirectly 
| join kind = inner appsReadingMailViaGraphAPI 
on OAuthAppId 
| project OAuthAppId 
```
