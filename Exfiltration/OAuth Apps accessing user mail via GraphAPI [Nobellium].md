# OAuth Apps accessing user mail via GraphAPI [Solorigate]

Review all OAuth Applications accessing user mail via Graph. 
This could return a significant number of results depending on how many applications are deployed in the environment. 

## Query

```kusto
CloudAppEvents 
| where Timestamp >= ago(1h) 
| where ActionType == "MailItemsAccessed" 
| where RawEventData has "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000" // performance 
| where RawEventData has "ClientAppId" 
| extend rawData = parse_json(RawEventData) 
| extend AppId = tostring(parse_json(rawData.AppId)) 
| where AppId == "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"         // graph API 
| extend OAuthAppId = tostring(parse_json(rawData.ClientAppId)) // extract OAuthAppId 
| summarize by OAuthAppId 
```
