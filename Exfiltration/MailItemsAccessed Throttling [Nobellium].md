# MailItemsAccessed Throttling [Solorigate] 

The new MailItemsAccessed action is part of the new Advanced Audit functionality. It's part of Exchange mailbox auditing and is enabled by default for users that are assigned an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 E5 license or for organizations with a Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance add-on subscription.

If more than 1,000 MailItemsAccessed audit records are generated in less than 24 hours, Exchange Online will
stop generating auditing records for MailItemsAccessed activity. When a mailbox is throttled, MailItemsAccessed
activity will not be logged for 24 hours after the mailbox was throttled. If this occurs, there's a potential that
mailbox could have been compromised during this period. 
The recording of MailItemsAccessed activity will be resumed following a 24-hour period.
